```

## Evaluation Process

### Step 1: PDF Processing
1. Convert PDF to high-resolution images (300 DPI)
2. Apply image preprocessing techniques
3. Enhance contrast and reduce noise
4. Correct skew and normalize orientation

### Step 2: OCR Text Extraction
1. Use multiple OCR engines in parallel
2. Apply handwriting-specific models
3. Extract text with confidence scores
4. Identify question boundaries and numbers

### Step 3: Question Detection
1. Analyze page layout using computer vision
2. Detect question numbers and boundaries
3. Map extracted text to specific questions
4. Identify skipped or unattempted questions

### Step 4: AI Evaluation
1. Compare student answers with model answers
2. Analyze conceptual understanding
3. Check factual accuracy and completeness
4. Evaluate presentation and clarity

### Step 5: Intelligent Scoring
1. Apply weighted scoring criteria:
   - Conceptual Understanding: 40%
   - Accuracy: 30%
   - Presentation: 20%
   - Completeness: 10%
2. Adjust for OCR confidence and handwriting quality
3. Assign partial credit intelligently
4. Generate detailed feedback

## Scoring Algorithm

### Conceptual Understanding Analysis
```javascript
if (keywordScore > 0.8) conceptScore = 1.0;     // Excellent understanding
else if (keywordScore > 0.6) conceptScore = 0.8; // Good understanding
else if (keywordScore > 0.4) conceptScore = 0.6; // Partial understanding
else if (keywordScore > 0.2) conceptScore = 0.4; // Minimal understanding
else conceptScore = 0.2;                         // Limited understanding
```

### Final Score Calculation
```javascript
finalScore = (
    conceptScore * 0.4 +      // 40% conceptual understanding
    accuracyScore * 0.3 +     // 30% accuracy
    presentationScore * 0.2 + // 20% presentation
    completenessScore * 0.1   // 10% completeness
) + ocrAdjustment + handwritingBonus;
```
